def: Codex Alimentarius, Volume 2 - 1993, Section 2:  Pesticide Residues in Food.\n\nThe Codex Classification of food and animal feed commodities moving in trade and the description of the various items and groups of food and animal feedstuffs included in the present document have been developed by the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues. It was first adopted by the 18th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, (1989).\n\nThe Codex Classification includes food commodities and animal feedstuffs for which Codex maximum residue limits will not necessarily be established. The Classification is intended to be as complete a listing of food commodities in trade as possible, classified into groups on the basis of the commodity's similar potential for pesticide residues.\n\nThe Classification may also be appropriate for other purposes such as setting maximum levels for other types of residues or for other contaminants in food. The Codex Classification should be consulted in order to obtain a precise description of the food or animal feed commodities and, especially, in cases where Codex maximum residue limits have been set for groups of food and groups of animal feedstuffs. The Codex Classification is intended to promote harmonization of the terms used to describe commodities which are subject to maximum residue limits and of the approach to grouping commodities with similar potential for residue for which a common group maximum residue limit can be set.@en"

def: The European Food Groups (EFG) classification system was developed, as a project of COST Action 99/Eurofoods, in an attempt to evaluate the level of food description and classification that would permit international comparisons of the results of available food consumption and food availability surveys. In order to formulate the EFG system, several classification schemes used for recording food intake at the international and national classification schemes were compared:  International - FAO Food Balance Sheet, WHO GEMS/FOODS regional diets, DAFNE classification system for Household Budget Survey (HBS) data, and Eurocode 2 core classification (levels 1 and 2); National  -   French National Food Consumption Survey (1999), Dutch National Food Consumption Survey (1998), and British National Food Survey.\nIn the process of comparing food intake data from various European countries, it became evident that such comparisons are feasible only when results are expressed at the raw ingredient level. Since the DAFNE classification system groups food items at the raw level, it was one of the international classification schemes used to create the EFG food grouping system.\nRef.:  Ireland, J., Van Erp-Baart, A.M.J., Charrondière, U.R., Møller, A., Smithers, G., and Trichopoulou, A.: Selection of food classification system and food composition database for future food consumption surveys.

def: Crustaceans are aquatic animals of various species, wild or cultivated, which have an inedible chitinous outer shell.\nA small number of species live in fresh water but most species live in brackish water and/or in the sea.\nExposure to pesticides is through animal metabolism or water pollution.\nCrustaceans are prepared for wholesale or retail distribution at a \"raw\" stage, often still alive, \"raw\" and deep-frozen or cooked directly after catching and deep-frozen. Shrimps or prawns may also be parboiled and thereafter deep-frozen.\nAlthough the cooked or parboiled crustaceans should be regarded as processed foods, the animals of this group are primarily classified in the Chapter on Primary food commodities, Type 8: Aquatic animal products, since several crustaceans are also-marketed in a \"raw\" form, i.e. not exposed to temperatures sufficiently high to coagulate the protein at the surface. A short reference to processed Crustaceans is given in Type 17: Derived edible products of animal origin, Group 084 Crustaceans, processed.\nThe entire commodity except the shell may be consumed: the \"raw\" commodities, in general, after cooking.\n\nIn some countries, species such as the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) are included in the commodity \"Prawns\" with some qualifying designation, such as Dublin Bay Prawn or Prawn of Bantry Bay (both Ireland).The Codex Stan. 92-1981 on Quick Frozen Shrimps and Prawns does not prevent this practice, provided that the designation on the label ensures that the consumer will not be misled.\nThere is no clear-cut distinction between Shrimps and Prawns. In several countries the commodity name-Shrimps is used for the small species whereas the slightly larger ones are called Prawns. However, a species marked in certain regions of the world as \"Prawn\" may be called in the local English language in other areas a shrimp and visa versa, e.g., Pandalus borcalis is called Northern prawn or Deepwater prawn in the United Kingdom and the same species is named Pink shrimp in Canada.

Some examples are: biscuits, cookies, dry pastry (e.g. savoury biscuits, sweet biscuits and cookies); sweet breads (e.g. croissants, currant bun, dough cakes like muffins or brioche, scone, doughnut); pastry (e.g. danish pastry, baclava); tart, pie (e.g. custard tart, mince pie); cakes (e.g. fruit cake, cream cake, sponge cake.@en"

def: Index dietary/food supplements according to legal and market definitions.\n\nThe United States defines dietary supplements in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA). Pub L 103-417, 108 STAT. 4235, (Oct. 25, 1994): A dietary supplement is a product taken by mouth that contains a \"dietary ingredient\" intended to supplement the diet. The \"dietary ingredients\" in these products may include: vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues, glandulars, and metabolites. Dietary supplements can also be extracts or concentrates, and may be found in many forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders.\n\nIn the European Union, food supplements are framed by two kinds of regulations: \n- the EU vertical regulation relating to food supplements, composed with the directive 2002/46/CE  (essentially for the definition of food supplements) and the regulation 1170/2009 (which lists the vitamins and minerals, and the chemical forms of the substances allowed in food supplements); \n- the EU transversal regulation relating to foodstuffs and especially the 2006/1924 regulation concerning nutrition and health claims, and the EU labeling transversal regulations, 90/496/EC and 2008/100/EC.\nThe EU regulation 2002/46/CE defines food supplements as \"foodstuffs the purpose of which is to supplement the normal diet and which are concentrated sources of nutrients or other substances with a nutritional or physiological effect, alone or in combination, marketed in dose form, namely forms such as capsules, pastilles, tablets, pills and other similar forms, sachets of powder, ampoules of liquids, drop dispensing bottles, and other similar forms of liquids and powders designed to be taken in measured small unit quantities\". [Directive 2002/46/EC]\n\nCodex Alimentarius also includes supplements containing vitamins or dietary minerals [http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/10206/cxg_055e.pdf]@en"

Enzyme supplements are extracted from plants like pineapple and papaya and from the organs of cows and pigs. The supplements are typically given in tablet or capsule form. Pancreatic enzymes may also be given by injection. The dosage varies with the condition being treated. For nondigestive ailments, the supplements are taken in the hour before meals so that they can be quickly absorbed into the blood. For digestive ailments, the supplements are taken immediately before meals accompanied by a large glass of fluids. Pancreatic enzymes may be accompanied by doses of vitamin A.[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/enzyme+therapy]@en"

Similar Vaccinium species in Europe are called bilberries. Berries range in color according to species from bright red, through dark purple, and into the blues. In taste the berries range from tart to sweet, with a flavor similar to that of a blueberry, especially in blue/purple colored varieties. [Wikipedia : ]@en" [WIKIPEDIA:Huckleberries]

def: The cashew is a tree in the family Anacardiaceae. Its English name derives from the Portuguese name for the fruit of the cashew tree, caju, which in turn derives from the indigenous Tupi name, acajú. It is now widely grown in tropical climates for its cashew nuts and cashew apples.\nThe fruit of the cashew tree is an accessory fruit (sometimes called a pseudocarp or false fruit). What appears to be the fruit is an oval or pear-shaped structure that develops from the pedicel and the receptacle of the cashew flower. Called the cashew apple, better known in Central America as \"marañón\", it ripens into a yellow and/or red structure about 5 to 11 cm long. It is edible, and has a strong \"sweet\" smell and a sweet taste. The pulp of the cashew apple is very juicy, but the skin is fragile, making it unsuitable for transport. In Latin America, a fruit drink is made from the cashew apple pulp which has a very refreshing taste and tropical flavor that can be described as having notes of mango, raw green pepper, and just a little hint of grapefruit-like citrus. The true fruit of the cashew tree is a kidney or boxing-glove shaped drupe that grows at the end of the cashew apple. The drupe develops first on the tree, and then the pedicel expands into the cashew apple. Within the true fruit is a single seed, the cashew nut. Although a nut in the culinary sense, in the botanical sense the nut of the cashew is a seed. The seed is surrounded by a double shell containing an allergenic phenolic resin, anacardic acid, a potent skin irritant chemically related to the more well known allergenic oil urushiol which is also a toxin found in the related poison ivy. Properly roasting cashews destroys the toxin, but it must be done outdoors as the smoke (not unlike that from burning poison ivy) contains urushiol droplets which can cause severe, sometimes life-threatening, reactions by irritating the lungs.@en" [WIKIPEDIA:Anacardium_occidentale]

def: The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, usually orange, purple, red, white, or yellow in colour, with a crisp texture when fresh. The edible part of a carrot is a taproot. It is a domesticated form of the wild carrot Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. It has been bred for its greatly enlarged and more palatable, less woody-textured edible taproot, but is still the same species. [Wikipedia]\n<DICTION>Daucus carota (common names include wild carrot, (UK) bird's nest, bishop's lace, and (US) Queen Anne's lace) is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae, native to temperate regions of Europe, southwest Asia and naturalised to northeast North America; domesticated carrots are cultivars of a subspecies, Daucus carota subsp. sativus. Like the cultivated carrot, the wild carrot root is edible while young, but quickly becomes too woody to consume. [Wikipedia]@en"

It is best known in its numerous cultivated varieties, the most well known of which is the root vegetable known as the beetroot or garden beet. However, other cultivated varieties include the leaf vegetables chard and spinach beet, as well as the root vegetables sugar beet, which is important in the production of table sugar, and mangelwurzel, which is a fodder crop. Three subspecies are typically recognised. All cultivated varieties fall into the subspecies *Beta vulgaris* subsp. *vulgaris*, while *Beta vulgaris* subsp. *maritima*, commonly known as the sea beet, is the wild ancestor of these, and is found throughout the Mediterranean, the Atlantic coast of Europe, the Near East, and India.

Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage), sweet corn is picked when immature (milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy.@en" [WIKIPEDIA:Sweet_corn]

def: The black crappie, Pomoxis nigromaculatus (Lesueur, 1829), is very similar to P. annularis in size, shape, and habits, except that it is darker, with a pattern of black spots. The black crappie has 7-8 spines on its dorsal fin. The number of spines on the dorsal fin, is occasionally the only way to differeniate between a juvenile black crappie and a white crappie. The black crappie tends to prefer clearer water than the white crappie does. Its native range is uncertain, since it has been so widely transplanted, but it is presumed to be similar to the white crappie's. The black crappie is also known as the strawberry bass or Oswego bass. (@en" [WIKIPEDIA:White_crappie)]

They are eaten especially in the summer, for their ability to reduce internal heat. They may be reconstituted and stir-fried, grated and used to thicken soup, or processed to extract starch. Their texture and taste draw comparison with the potato, although the individual bulb scales are much smaller (Source:@en" [WIKIPEDIA:Lily).]

def: Scurvy-grass (Cochlearia species; a.k.a. Scurvy grass, Scurvygrass, or Spoonwort) is a genus of about 30 species of annual and perennial herbs in the cabbage family Brassicaceae. They are widely distributed in temperate and arctic areas of the northern hemisphere, most commonly found in coastal regions, on cliff-tops and salt marshes where their high tolerance of salt enables them to avoid competition from larger, but less salt-tolerant plants; they also occur in alpine habitats in mountains and tundra.\n \nScurvy-grass was extensively eaten in the past by sailors suffering from scurvy after returning from long voyages, as the leaves are rich in vitamin C, which cures this deficiency disease resulting from a lack of fresh vegetables in the diet. The leaves, which have a strong peppery taste similar to the related horseradish and watercress, are also sometimes used in salads.@en" [WIKIPEDIA:Cochlearia]

Common names include lemon verbena and lemon beebrush. It was brought to Europe by the Spanish and the Portuguese in the 17th century.\n\nLemon verbena leaves are used to add a lemon flavor to fish and poultry dishes, vegetable marinades, salad dressings, jams, puddings, greek yogurt and beverages. It also is used to make herbal teas, or added to standard tea in place of actual lemon (as is common with Moroccan tea). It can also be used to make a sorbet. In addition, it has anti-Candida albicans activity. In the European Union, Verbena essential oils (Lippia citriodora Kunth.) and derivatives other than absolute are prohibited when used as a fragrance ingredient (Commission Directive 2009/164/EU of 22 December 2009).@en" [WIKIPEDIA:Lemon_verbena]

Salmon are capable of going hundreds of kilometers upriver, and humans must install fish ladders in dams to enable the salmon to get past. Catadromous fish live in fresh water, breed in the sea; the most remarkable are freshwater eels of genus Anguilla, whose larvae drift on the open ocean, sometimes for months or years, before travelling thousands of kilometres back to their original streams. Amphidromous fish move between fresh and salt water during some part of life cycle, but not for breeding. (@en" [WIKIPEDIA:Diadromous_fish)]

Porpoises (suborder Odontoceti, family Phocoenidae) are thus not dolphins in this sense. Orcas and some related species belong to the Delphinidae family and therefore qualify as dolphins, even though they are called whales in common language. There are almost 40 species of dolphin in 17 genera. They vary in size from 1.2 m (4 ft) and 40 kg (88 lb) (Maui's Dolphin), up to 9.5 m (30 ft) and 10 tonnes (the Orca). However, the average length for most North American Species is 13.89 feet in length. Most species weigh about 50 to 200 kg (110 to 440 lb). They are found worldwide, mostly in the shallower seas of the continental shelves, and are carnivores, mostly eating fish and squid.

Wild yaks (Bos mutus) stand about two meters tall at the shoulder. Domestic yaks are about half that height. Both types have long shaggy hair to insulate them from the cold. Wild yaks can be either brown or black. Domesticated ones can also be white. Both males and females have horns.

The two species met at the Caucasus Mountains, with the European species occupying the southern flank of the mountain ranges and adjacent Asia Minor and the Siberian species occupying the northern flank of the mountain ranges. Within Europe, the European Roe Deer occurs in most areas, with the exception of northern Scandinavia and some of the islands, notably Iceland, Ireland, and the Mediterranean Sea islands; in the Mediterranean region it is largely confined to mountainous regions, and is absent or rare at low levels. The Roe Deer is a relatively small deer, with a body length of 95-135 cm, a shoulder height of 65-75 cm, and a weight of 15-30 kg. It has rather short, erect antlers and a reddish body with a grey face. Its hide is golden red in summer, darkening to brown or even black in winter, with lighter undersides and a white rump patch; the tail is very short (2-3 cm), and barely visible.

Their scientific name was originally Bos indicus, but this name is now deemed invalid by ITIS, who classify the zebu under Bos taurus along with all other domestic cattle, and their aurochs ancestors, domesticated in India about 10,000 years ago. The ancient species of Bos nomadicus cattle or even gaur may have contributed to the development of the zebus. There are some 75 known breeds, split about evenly between African breeds and South Asian ones. The major Zebu cattle breeds of the world include Gyr, Guzerat, Indu-Brazilian, Nellore, Ongole and Brahman. Zebu have humps, large dewlaps and ears. They have more sweat glands than European cattle (Bos taurus). They handle hot, humid climates well and have pest resistances not seen in European cattle. (@en" [WIKIPEDIA:Zebu)]

def: Gulls or seagulls are seabirds of the family *Laridae* in the sub-order *Lari*. They are most closely related to the terns (family *Sternidae*) and only distantly related to auks, skimmers, and more distantly to the waders. Until the twenty-first century most gulls were placed in the genus *Larus*, but this arrangement is now known to be polyphyletic, leading to the resurrection of several genera. An older name for gulls is mew, cognate with German \"Möwe\", Danish \"måge\", Dutch \"meeuw\" and French \"mouette\"; this term can still be found in certain regional dialects.].@en" [WIKIPEDIA:Gull]

def: Einkorn wheat (from German Einkorn, literally \"single grain\") can refer either to the wild species of wheat, Triticum boeoticum (the spelling baeoticum is also common), or to the domesticated form, Triticum monococcum. The wild and domesticated forms are either considered separate species, as here, or as subspecies of T. monococcum. Einkorn is a diploid species of hulled wheat, with tough glumes ('husks') that tightly enclose the grains. The cultivated form is similar to the wild, except that the ear stays intact when ripe and the seeds are larger.@en" [WIKIPEDIA:Einkorn]

def: Xiphopenaeus kroyeri was first described by Camill Heller in 1862, under the name Penaeus kroyeri. It was transferred to the genus Xiphopenaeus in 1869 by Sidney Irving Smith. X. kroyeri has been considered conspecific with the Pacific species X. riveti, but recent genetic analysis indicates that the two are separate species, and that X. kroyeri (sensu stricto) may even constitute two cryptic species.@en" [WIKIPEDIA:Xiphopenaeus_kroyeri]

Externally, a poultice of the leaves is useful for insect bites, poison-ivy rashes, minor sores, and boils. In folklore it is even claimed to be able to cure snakebite. Internally, it is used for coughs and bronchitis, as a tea, tincture, or syrup. The broad-leaved varieties are sometimes used as a leaf vegetable for salads, green sauce, et cetera. Plantain seed husks expand and become mucilaginous when wet, especially those of *Plantago psyllium*, which is used in common over-the-counter bulk laxative and fiber supplement products. []@en"

An example of a top-cropping yeast is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sometimes called an \"ale yeast\". Bottom-cropping yeasts are typically used to produce lager-type beers, though they can also produce ale-type beers. These yeasts ferment well at low temperatures. An example of bottom-cropping yeast is *Saccharomyces pastorianus*, formerly known as *Saccharomyces carlsbergensis*.\n<DICTION>*Saccharomyces pastorianus* is a yeast used industrially for the production of lager beer, and is named after Louis Pasteur.

Leaves are small, 1-6 cm long and 3-25 mm wide, glabrous, with a notched tip and crenate towards the apex. Flowers are white with petals 6-9 mm long. The fruit is cylindrical, 4-8 cm long, sometimes slightly curved, coming in different colours, including pink and green.\nEarly settlers consumed the fruit and retained the trees when clearing for agriculture. Colonial botanists suggested that they should be cultivated.\nThe finger lime has been recently popularised as a gourmet bushfood. The globular juice vesicles have been likened to a \"lime caviar\", which can be used as a garnish or added to various recipes. The fresh vesicles have the effect of a burst of effervescent tangy flavour as they are chewed. The fruit juice is acidic and similar to that of a lime. Marmalade and pickles are also made from finger lime. The finger lime peel can be dried and used as a flavouring spice.\n \nThere is a wide range of different coloured variants of finger lime fruit, including green, yellow, orange, red, purple, black and brown.

Sometimes there is dark coloring on the exterior of the rind as well, depending on the variety of blood orange. The skin can also be more tough and harder to peel than other oranges.\nWhile all oranges are likely of hybrid origin between the pomelo and the tangerine, blood oranges originated as a mutation of the sweet orange. \nWithin Europe, the Arancia Rossa di Sicilia (Red Orange of Sicily) has Protected Geographical Status.@en" [WIKIPEDIA:Blood_orange]

def: Searing (or pan searing) is a technique used in grilling, roasting, braising, sautéing, etc. that cooks the surface of the food (usually meat, poultry or fish) at high temperature so that a brownish crust forms by Maillard reaction and denaturation of proteins. A similar technique, browning, is typically used to sear or brown all sides of a particular piece of meat, fish, poultry, etc. before finishing it in the oven. To obtain the desired brown crust, the meat surface must exceed 300 °F (150 °C), so searing requires the meat surface be free of water, which boils at around 212 °F (100 °C).@en"

def: A food product is characterized by its main ingredient (food source and part); the addition of secondary ingredients is considered a treatment applied to the product. Secondary ingredients are indexed according to rules that are based on the order of predominance by weight (not counting water) as seen from the label statement, formulation or recipe and/or from the amount of the ingredient as percentage of total product weight. The general rule is:  an ingredient is always indexed if it is the second ingredient in order of predominance, if it is used as a filling, or if it is part of the product name(e.g., raisin bread). Specific rules are given in the scope note for the individual ingredient added; these rules specify more exhaustive indexing. For example, *MUSHROOM ADDED* is indexed regardless of ingredient position. another specific rule is given in the scope note for *SALTED*:  Use if the level of salt is more than 4%. Such a rule is used only when the percentage level can be inferred from the list of ingredients.@en"

def: Micro-encapsulation is a process in which tiny particles or droplets are surrounded by a coating to give small capsules many useful properties. In a relatively simplistic form, a microcapsule is a small sphere with a uniform wall around it. The material inside the microcapsule is referred to as the core, internal phase, or fill, whereas the wall is sometimes called a shell, coating, or membrane. Most microcapsules have diameters between a few micrometers and a few millimeters.\nThe definition has been expanded, and includes most foods. Every class of food ingredient has been encapsulated; flavors are the most common. The technique of microencapsulation depends on the physical and chemical properties of the material to be encapsulated.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-encapsulation]@en" [WIKIPEDIA:Micro-encapsulation]

def: In the past, smoking was a useful preservation tool, in combination with other techniques, most commonly salt-curing or drying. For some long-smoked foods, the smoking time also served to dry the food. Drying, curing, or other techniques can render the interior of foods inhospitable to bacterial life, while the smoking gives the vulnerable exterior surfaces an extra layer of protection.

def: Health claim means any claim made on the label or in labeling of a food, including a dietary supplement, that expressly or by implication, including \"third party\" references, written statements (e.g., a brand name including a term such as \"heart\"), symbols (e.g., a heart symbol), or vignettes, characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition. See also 21 CFR 101.14  [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.14].\n\nA claim is a health claim if in the naming of the substance or category of substances, there is a description or indication of a functionality or an implied effect on health; examples: \"contains antioxidants\" (the function is an antioxidant effect); \"containsprobiotics/prebiotics\" (the reference to probiotic/prebiotic implies a health benefit). Equally, claims which refer to an indication of a functionality in the description of a nutrient or a substance (for instance as an adjective to the substance) should also beclassified as a health claim; examples: \"with prebiotic fibres\" or \"contains prebiotic fibres\".\n\nIn Europe, a health claim is any statement about a relationship between food and health [http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/claims/health_claims_en.htm], and only authorized health claims are legal [see http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/claims/community_register/health_claims_en.htm].\nCOMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 432/2012 of 16 May 2012 establishes a list of permitted health claims made on foods, other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to childrens development and health [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:136:0001:0040:en:PDF]@en"

def: Protected Geographical Status (PGS) is a legal framework[1] defined in European Union law to protect the names of regional foods. Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) are geographical indications, or more precisely regimes, within the framework. The law (enforced within the EU and being gradually expanded internationally via bilateral agreements of the EU with non-EU countries) ensures that only products genuinely originating in that region are allowed in commerce as such. The legislation came into force in 1992. The purpose of the law is to protect the reputation of the regional foods and eliminate the unfair competition and misleading of consumers by non-genuine products,[2] which may be of inferior quality or of different flavour.
